Thank you.<br><br>More coffee, Julia?<br><br>Do you think Annette is going to be grateful to you for hauling her into the wilderness?<br><br>In time. And as for Norman, I can only tell you this:<br><br>there\\'s not going to be a carriage with two ponies<br><br>waiting for him at nine o\\'clock every morning.<br><br>From now on, he\\'s going to walk to school.<br><br>Hm.

He\\'s a runaway. -From what, some woman?<br><br>No. He\\'s running too fast for that.<br><br>What\\'s the commotion?<br><br>Well, where I come from, this would either be a revival meetin\\' or a craps game.<br><br>Step up and get your tickets for the anchor pool.<br><br>Ten dollars gets you a chance to win 600.<br><br>Wait a minute. I wanna get in on this.<br><br>MAUDE: How do you play this?<br><br>Just draw a number. If it corresponds to the minute we drop anchor, you win.<br><br>Five.<br><br>Don\\'t be shy, Mr. Straus. Draw a good one.<br><br>You draw, Mama.<br><br>-What\\'s our lucky number, dear? -Seventeen.<br><br>Hey, Tom... Here you get it, will ya?<br><br>Morning. They\\'re selling tickets on the anchor pool down there.<br><br>-Oh? -Yes, I... I thought you didn\\'t notice.<br><br>Maybe you want a ticket. I could get one for you.<br><br>-No, thank you. I\\'m not much of a gambler. -Oh.<br><br>-How about some soup? Nice and hot. -Thank you. I just had some.<br><br>This is for Purdue. It\\'s a college out in Indiana.<br><br>Everybody thinks it\\'s Princeton, but it\\'s Purdue.<br><br>I see. Well, to answer your questions:<br><br>Her name is Annette, she\\'s going on 18, and I think she\\'s very pretty too.<br><br>Well, now that you brought it up,<br><br>-I think I kinda got off on the wrong foot with her. -Oh?<br><br>Yes, last night, when I asked if I could have the deck chair next to her,<br><br>she said she\\'d rather stand all the way to New York.<br><br>Oh! What\\'s your name?<br><br>Giff Rogers. Gifford is a family name.<br><br>My mother said one of us kids had to be called Gifford.<br><br>-Oh, I\\'m sorry. I always get friendly pop off the bat. -Sit down.<br><br>I\\'m on the tennis team.<br><br>The athletic association shot us over to play Oxford during Easter.<br><br>We didn\\'t win a single match.<br><br>-Will she be at the dance tonight? -She likes music well enough.<br><br>Well, I better hurry and get my blue suit pressed.<br><br>(chuckles) Still the same. Young men hurrying to get their blue suits pressed.<br><br>Mrs. Sturges, I bet I can count on you to put in a good word for me.<br><br>\"When I was one and twenty, I heard a wise man say,<br><br>\\'Give crowns and pounds and guineas, but not your heart away.<br><br>Give pearls away and rubies, but keep your fancy free.\\'<br><br>But I was one and twenty. No use to talk to me.<br><br>When I was one and twenty, I heard him say again,<br><br>\\'The heart out of the bosom was never given in vain.<br><br>\\'Tis paid with sighs aplenty, and sold for endless rue.\\'\"<br><br>That\\'s pretty, but do you believe it?<br><br>I can\\'t answer for myself, but if I were a tennis player from Purdue,<br><br>I wouldn\\'t believe it, not a single word.<br><br>A fine, healthy bumpkin.<br><br>-Are you breaking ground for Annette? -You\\'re up early.<br><br>I had to scratch around for something to wear. Not a bad shop; they have everything.<br><br>-Dinner jackets, I trust? -Naturally.<br><br>It\\'ll be ready tonight. So... life can go on.<br><br>-JULIA: Good morning, Annette. -RICHARD: Morning, darling.<br><br>Oh, Dad, I thought you were a pot of coffee. What time is it?<br><br>Eleven o\\'clock. A brand-new day that\\'s never been touched.<br><br>ANNETTE: I\\'m absolutely famished!<br><br>-That brother of yours, he never picks up anything. Where is he? -Where\\'s my breakfast?<br><br>I sent him to order it half an hour ago.<br><br>-Beautiful! Lanvin? -Mm-hm.<br><br>-This one, Lucile, I imagine. -Yes, angel.<br><br>Your mother seems to have packed everything.<br><br>Of course, some of them will be a little out of place in Mackinac.<br><br>Still, plenty of practical things.<br><br>What? Only high heels? You\\'ll have to have something to walk in.<br><br>Julia, as soon as we arrive, I think you ought to buy her some of those flat shoes.<br><br>They\\'re called ground grippers, I believe. She\\'ll need lots of things.<br><br>-That would be a waste of money for just a short visit. -Visit?<br><br>JULIA: Let\\'s not talk about wardrobe and shoes now. Get up, Annette.<br><br>As your mother has said, it\\'s a brand-new day that\\'s never been touched.<br><br>-(knocking on door) -Yes?<br><br>Ah, thank you, Emma. Those cheeks of yours bloom in the salt air.<br><br>Oh! Mr. Sturges!<br><br>Annette.<br><br>There we are.<br><br>-May I bone your kipper, mademoiselle? -ANNETTE: Yes, angel.<br><br>-Is today the 12th or the 13th? -The 13th.<br><br>With the time difference, they should just be sitting down to luncheon<br><br>in that extraordinary room overlooking the fountains.<br><br>The dear, arthritic old princess sitting under the finest crystal chandelier in Europe,<br><br>and Mr. Paderewski complaining about the draft...<br><br>and at the end of the table, one young man next to an empty chair with a tear in his eye.<br><br>A crystal tear is my guess.<br><br>-What excuse did you give him, Annette? -I dropped them a note.<br><br>-Let\\'s go, Richard. -What note? Was I to be somewhere?<br><br>It\\'s perfectly all right if your mother explained it to them. See you later, Annette.<br><br>Wait a minute. Explain it to me.<br><br>What\\'s the difference one party more or less?<br><br>Now, Julia, a luncheon at the Metternichs\\' is not exactly a wiener roast.<br><br>Was there some reason I wasn\\'t told I was invited to the Metternichs\\'?<br><br>Annette, your mother\\'s a sensible woman.<br><br>She probably felt something might come of it.<br><br>Some involvement with the young master.<br><br>To be perfectly frank, I was afraid. He\\'s an arrogant little toad.<br><br>Mm. He does look a little like a toad, but he\\'s a highly eligible toad.<br><br>Not many young men are related to both the Metternichs and the Rothschilds.<br><br>I don\\'t think he looks in the least like a toad.<br><br>I see no reason we couldn\\'t have left a week later.<br><br>I\\'m sorry I\\'m not there and I think it was mean of you!<br><br>RICHARD: Annette, mind your manners!<br><br>It wasn\\'t a question of a week or two weeks. This was as good a time as any to bow out.<br><br>-Bow out? -Yes. I\\'m afraid so.<br><br>Adieu, great world.<br><br>Your father is saying that I\\'m taking you home for good. You may as well know it now.<br><br>I won\\'t see an arranged marriage, I won\\'t see you jumping from party to party,<br><br>from title to title, all the rest of your life.<br><br>Father, I want to ask you one question. Do you approve of all this?<br><br>Annette, I adore you. You know that.<br><br>Are you going to stay in Michigan for good?<br><br>I\\'m a hopeless case, far too old to alter my preferences now.<br><br>-When are you going back? -RICHARD: On the next boat.<br><br>Whenever you go, I go with you.<br><br>As for you, Mother, I love you very much,<br><br>but my address is Paris, France.<br><br>Thank you, Richard. You were most helpful.<br><br>Now you see why I wanted to steal a little more time.<br><br>Please, Julia, let\\'s not bicker since there\\'s no love lost between us.<br><br>That\\'s the tragic part, Richard.<br><br>There\\'s been so much love lost between us.<br><br>Hurry up! We have our first match at 11:30.<br><br>If it\\'s not asking too much, what match?<br><br>The shuffleboard tournament. I entered us, you and me.<br><br>Good. We\\'re the team to beat.<br><br>-I\\'m going to dress for dinner. -Yes, sir.<br><br>You\\'ll alter course at 10:00. It\\'s posted in the chart house.<br><br>What\\'s this note, \"binoculars\"?<br><br>-That\\'s Murdoch\\'s writing. We\\'re shy on binoculars. -How did that happen?<br><br>I don\\'t know, sir. We\\'ve got just enough for the bridge.<br><br>The lookouts in the crow\\'s nests are doing without.<br><br>-Make out a requisition. We\\'ll pick up some in New York. -Yes, sir.<br><br>-It\\'s very nice material. -Yes, it\\'s a beautiful suit.<br><br>I said it was nice material.<br><br>You did a fast job. Thank you. I better have a handkerchief.<br><br>Norman, it\\'s time for us to pick up our ladies.<br><br>-Norman! -Yes, sir?<br><br>Father, would it be all right if I ate in the cabin tonight?<br><br>Don\\'t be silly, Norman. We\\'re dining at the captain\\'s table.<br><br>That\\'s just it, sir. I\\'d feel out of place.<br><br>There\\'s something bothering you. What is it?<br><br>It\\'s nothing, sir.<br><br>(chuckles) Is this what\\'s worrying you?<br><br>Look, Father. There are two other boys on this ship.<br><br>They\\'re an inch shorter than I am, and they have long trousers.<br><br>Norman, you\\'re a worthless scamp.<br><br>You\\'ve been growing behind my back.<br><br>Mr. Webster, this is no way to let a young man walk out of your shop.<br><br>-It seems you\\'ll have to put in some more overtime. -It\\'s a pleasure, sir.<br><br>Your fitting, Mr. Sturges.<br><br>Thank you, sir.<br><br>Mother, could you help me with this snap, please?<br><br>If you\\'re busy, I can call for the stewardess.<br><br>That won\\'t be necessary.<br><br>I love those earrings on you.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Are we going to cross the entire ocean in polite silence?<br><br>Annette, I\\'d be very happy to chatter like a magpie<br><br>if I could think of a single word to say.<br><br>-(knocking on door) -JULIA: Come in.<br><br>-Well, are we ready? -ANNETTE: Yes, angel.<br><br>-Julia, you look very beautiful. -I\\'m glad you\\'re pleased.<br><br>Annette, Norman\\'s at the tailor shop. Will you pick him up?<br><br>I don\\'t want to walk into the dining room with him.<br><br>Then you can trail at a respectful distance.<br><br>-We\\'ll all meet at the captain\\'s table. -Yes, angel.<br><br>Well, Julia, I imagine after a few hours, we\\'ve reached the same conclusion.<br><br>We scream, we shout, we hurt each other, but we calm down.<br><br>Things aren\\'t so bad.<br><br>Things are never bad for you, Richard. You always win.<br><br>I don\\'t regard this as a victory. It\\'s an adjustment.<br><br>Before you go down and eat and drink, you\\'d better know how things are going to be.<br><br>I\\'ve given up on Annette. Her standards will always be the chic club, the best table,<br><br>the Royal Enclosure, and that\\'s her decision. She\\'s almost of age.<br><br>But Norman is still a child. I\\'m not taking any chances with him. He stays in America.<br><br>Now, wait a minute, Julia. What is this all about?<br><br>I should think it\\'d be perfectly clear.<br><br>I\\'m not gonna see Norman thrown away.<br><br>He stays with me and if you try to interfere, I\\'ll be as common as you think I am!<br><br>I\\'ll fight you tooth and nail. I\\'ll take you to the courts!<br><br>Could you be common in a slightly lower voice?<br><br>I\\'ll say it in any tone you want. I\\'ll whisper, I\\'ll write it down.<br><br>That\\'s the way it\\'s going to be! He stays with me!<br><br>You crazy woman. You\\'re talking about the most important thing in my life.<br><br>-I have plans for Norman. -What plans? That he should grow up to be you?<br><br>Possibly. I\\'m satisfied.<br><br>Is it so extraordinary that I should want to have some hint, some portion of myself survive?<br><br>Some portion of-- Yes, I forgot. \"The best-dressed man of his day.\"<br><br>That\\'s what they\\'re going to write on your tombstone.<br><br>That may be all right for you, but I won\\'t have it for Norman. He stays with me.<br><br>My dear Julia, I\\'ve been around enough bridge tables<br><br>to recognize someone who is holding a high trump.<br><br>Play it now, if you\\'re going to.<br><br>We\\'ll discuss it later.<br><br>Now!<br><br>All right, Richard. One question first?<br><br>If it\\'s about Norman, you know the answer.<br><br>No court in the world,<br><br>no power under heaven can force me to give up my son.<br><br>He is not your son.<br><br>(folk music playing)<br><br>(orchestra plays)<br><br>-All I propose, Mr. Straus, is a small game at small stakes. -Oh, yes.<br><br>Don\\'t act as though I were working the banana boats. I prefer good bridge and poverty.<br><br>-SANDY: It sounds rather like Saint Francis, doesn\\'t it? -(people laughing)<br><br>Excuse me. Mr. Sturges, there\\'s someone looking for you.<br><br>-Richard, this young man. -Yes?<br><br>At the door, there\\'s a woman. Some name like Uzcadum.<br><br>-She\\'s French, I guess. -Thank you.<br><br>-RICHARD: Will you excuse me a moment, Captain? -I believe we\\'ve all finished.<br><br>Do you expect to be long in New York, Mrs. Astor?<br><br>Hello. Your mother thought you might be in the mood for dancing tonight.<br><br>She and I got to be very good friends.<br><br>Oh, I\\'m afraid I forgot to mention you, Mr. Rogers. You\\'ll have to forgive me.<br><br>My daughter and I were talking about something else.<br><br>-If Mr. Rogers would like a dance, I\\'d be delighted. -You would?<br><br>The dance floor is this way, isn\\'t it?<br><br>Say, his is great, and the band\\'s slicker than beets.<br><br>Wait till you meet the other fellas.<br><br>-We\\'re going to have one dance. -Just one?<br><br>I was quite horrid to my mother today.<br><br>If I can please her a little by dancing with you...<br><br>as I said before, I\\'d be delighted.<br><br>Okay. What\\'s the difference?<br><br>If you get a good omelet, who cares whether the chicken likes you or not?<br><br>Keep going.<br><br>All right. Now, sign this too.<br><br>Both of them.<br><br>I still say, not right to sign this. I am not head of family. You--<br><br>Please, Mrs. Uzcadum, do me a favor and stop worrying. Here, sign it.<br><br>-(music stops) -(applause)<br><br>(music continues)<br><br>Now, you keep these papers. I\\'ll send the steward tomorrow.<br><br>Say... We\\'re getting up a bridge game.<br><br>Sandy Comstock tells me you\\'re a player from way back.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(door closes)<br><br>You need a topcoat, Richard. It\\'s grown cold.<br><br>Yes, it has.<br><br>The Labrador current.<br><br>I wonder if you\\'d tell me, Julia.<br><br>Have I been the laughingstock of our friends all these years?<br><br>Does everybody know?<br><br>No one except you and me.<br><br>Aren\\'t you forgetting at least one other person?<br><br>Not even he. I never saw him again.<br><br>What very good manners.<br><br>There\\'s no way for me to make it seem right.<br><br>It happened after one of those endless rows and private humiliations...<br><br>in the days before you made me over into your image.<br><br>One of the summers we had the beach house.<br><br>I\\'d left a party that night because I knew I\\'d cry<br><br>if there was one more reference made to my gaucherie, to the...<br><br>To the dress I had chosen to wear.<br><br>On the beach by our cottage,<br><br>there was a young man skipping stones across the water.<br><br>He assured me he was not a burglar, and we began to talk.<br><br>He said something admiring to me when I needed it most.<br><br>A pure, sweet, unsolicited compliment.<br><br>I... I took his face in my hands and kissed him out of gratitude.<br><br>You...<br><br>You needn\\'t trouble yourself as to who he was...<br><br>except that he was a much nicer person than you or I.<br><br>(purse hits deck)<br><br>I think I understand.<br><br>From now on, Norman belongs to you. I shall make no claim.<br><br>Both of you will be taken care of decently.<br><br>But I don\\'t want to see him or hear from him or... be remembered by him.<br><br>-Is that really necessary? -I\\'m afraid it is.<br><br>As you pointed out, Norman and I began as strangers.<br><br>So be it.<br><br>Oh, my poor Richard. How you hate me.<br><br>And for the wrong reasons.<br><br>Not because I committed an offense against common decency,<br><br>but because Norman isn\\'t an elegant extension of Richard Ward Sturges.<br><br>For you, what happened isn\\'t a mortal sin.<br><br>It is an inexcusable breach of etiquette.<br><br>Thank you, Julia. I stand reproved.<br><br>Good evening, Mr....<br><br>Harry. Thank you.<br><br>I see you have your game.<br><br>And you\\'re in it. Mr. Guggenheim\\'s been keeping the seat warm.<br><br>Two no trump. A heart bid from there.<br><br>You can only play one more rubber, Mr. Straus.<br><br>-Whenever you feel like stopping, I can take over, sir. -My trick.<br><br>Do you mind?<br><br>Aldebaran...<br><br>you lonely star.<br><br>GEORGE: Look around at the others.<br><br>The friendly Pleiades are better off. There\\'s seven of \\'em.<br><br>Now, wait. Let me count.<br><br>Answer up for the roll call.<br><br>There\\'s four, six, seven.<br><br>They\\'re all there.<br><br>Have you ever noticed, my dear lady, that the stars are never late?<br><br>They made you cry,<br><br>or wasn\\'t it the stars?<br><br>Yes. Yes, I... I\\'m drunk.<br><br>I\\'m always two things: I\\'m drunk and I\\'m helpful.<br><br>Thank you. I don\\'t need any help.<br><br>Then you\\'re very, very unique. Oh! \"Very unique.\"<br><br>It\\'s a grammatical error. \"Unique\" stands by itself.<br><br>(hits deck)<br><br>Are you hurt?<br><br>(groans) I\\'m all right.<br><br>If... you would just be so kind as to point me toward the bar.<br><br>You\\'re going to your cabin. What number is it?<br><br>My dear, unique lady, I am going to the bar.<br><br>No, you\\'re not. Where\\'s the key to your cabin?<br><br>-I\\'ll send in the ship\\'s doctor. -No, no, no, let him sleep.<br><br>I\\'ve got some, uh, spirits of ammonia over here.<br><br>I\\'ll get it. Sit down.<br><br>Take this.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Thank you for being so generous.<br><br>-That\\'s all right. Just go to bed. -You know what I mean.<br><br>Thank you for not mentioning my strange luggage.<br><br>Are you a minister?<br><br>A priest, or rather, I was until last week.<br><br>At three o\\'clock on April 8th,<br><br>my duties, my privileges as a servant of God were formally terminated.<br><br>It was this.<br><br>You know why I started, or at least the reason I gave myself?<br><br>A priest in a slum parish knows all the sadness of the world. He needs support.<br><br>So I used to lean on a little Hennessy\\'s. Just a little at first.<br><br>People said, \"Well, that\\'s only natural. The young father has a bad cold.\"<br><br>(chuckles)<br><br>It got so I used to have those colds in the middle of July, lots of \\'em.<br><br>I can hear the bishop\\'s voice now.<br><br>\"You prefer that stuff to your God?\"<br><br>Well, God and I knew better, but... I couldn\\'t stop,<br><br>because I had a private devil all of my own.<br><br>In Rome, they were very kind, but they were very final.<br><br>I was sacked, and prayed for, and sent off in the morning.<br><br>How do you cover that in ten words in a wireless<br><br>to a family that loved you and sacrificed for you?<br><br>You see, my dear lady, you\\'re not the only one who walks in trouble.<br><br>Goodnight.<br><br>(door closes)<br><br>-Can I have some eggs, please? -Three minutes.<br><br>-How\\'s topside? -(bell ringing)<br><br>Is that bridge game still going on in the lounge?<br><br>I don\\'t think they\\'re ever gonna stop.<br><br>Time to relieve the chief.<br><br>Be careful of that coffee. It can stand up and walk.<br><br>(chuckles)<br><br>Morning, Chief.<br><br>-Good morning. -Ready to relieve.<br><br>Steering south, 71 west. Speed 21 knots.<br><br>Twenty-one? Who ordered the increase?<br><br>The captain.<br><br>Jackson.<br><br>Take over a moment. I must speak to the captain.<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Holy, holy, holy<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Though the darkness hide thee \\xe2\\x99\\xaa<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Though the eye of sinful man \\xe2\\x99\\xaa<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Thy glory may not see<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Only thou art holy<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa There is none beside thee \\xe2\\x99\\xaa<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Perfect in power \\xe2\\x99\\xaa<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa In love and purity<br><br>\\xe2\\x99\\xaa Amen<br><br>The Lord bless us and keep us.<br><br>The Lord make his face to shine upon us and be gracious unto us.<br><br>The Lord lift up his countenance upon us, and give us peace now and forevermore.<br><br>Amen.<br><br>-Good morning. -Good morning, Captain.<br><br>Lovely day, isn\\'t it?<br><br>LIGHTOLLER: Excuse me, sir.<br><br>There\\'s an iceberg warning posted in the chart house.<br><br>Yes, I know. I put it there.<br><br>I just wondered about our speed, sir.<br><br>It\\'s a clear sea,<br><br>and our track takes us quite a bit south of the reported ice field.<br><br>-Anything else? -No, sir.<br><br>Er... Mr. and Mrs. Astor, I should like you to meet our second officer, Mr. Lightoller.<br><br>How do you do?<br><br>-He\\'s worried about our ship. -Not worried, sir.<br><br>I remember a man like that in the old days. Always afraid we were carrying too much sail.<br><br>But the wind never did us any harm. I like your spirit, Mr. Lightoller.<br><br>Thank you, sir.<br><br>-All right if I skip now, Mother? Big match coming up. -Yes, dear.<br><br>I believe that\\'s your trick, Widener.<br><br>Are you leaving it there to hatch?<br><br>(chuckles) Sorry, Sturges. I\\'m knocked out.<br><br>It\\'s almost 10:30, Father. We should have a warm-up.<br><br>This may be a tough match.<br><br>You\\'ll have to find someone else, Norman. I\\'m busy.<br><br>-Yes, sir. -SANDY: An evenhanded rubber.<br><br>That\\'s enough for me.<br><br>I guess it\\'s time for us all to quit.<br><br>I see no reason for stopping. We\\'ll get a fourth.<br><br>I\\'ll be glad to fill in, Mr. Sturges, if it\\'s all right with everybody?<br><br>Please do. Cut.<br><br>The name\\'s Meeker. Earl Meeker.<br><br>All right. Let\\'s have more coffee and double the stakes.<br><br>-How much do I owe? -We\\'ll let you know.<br><br>Excuse me, Father, but if you\\'re busy, maybe I could have the match postponed--<br><br>I told you, Norman, I\\'m not interested in the match. Find someone else!<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>-RICHARD: A spade. -SANDY: Pass.<br><br>MAUDE: Two hearts.<br><br>He certainly clouded up.<br><br>Well, a word\\'ll do it faster than a hickory stick anytime.<br><br>A spade, two hearts. Your call.<br><br>MEEKER: I pass.<br><br>Morning.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>I guess it\\'s of no importance, but I wanted to tell you something about last night.<br><br>No need to.<br><br>You danced with me four times. It\\'s more than I figured on.<br><br>No, I mean the way I walked off without saying anything.<br><br>It wasn\\'t very adult of me, and I believe in being adult.<br><br>Forget it. You did your bit. Only I kind of figured you were having a good time.<br><br>-To be frank, I was. -So you left me standing right in the middle of the floor?<br><br>That\\'s just it! I didn\\'t know what to do<br><br>when the orchestra started playing that funny dance.<br><br>-What do they call it? -\"The Navajo Rag\"?<br><br>-That\\'s the one. I\\'d never heard it-- -Never heard it before?<br><br>Where have you been?

Her husband, Richard, also arranges passage on the doomed luxury liner in order to allow him to have custody of their two children, Annette and Norman. Meanwhile, Annette begins a romance with a young American college student and tennis player, Gifford Rogers. Unfortunately, their family problems soon seem minor when the Titanic strikes an iceberg.\n",

She was a fine sea boat.\\xa0Shall we hoist it, sir?\\xa0She\\'s not top issue nowadays, but up she goes.\\xa0Mr. Sanderson.\\xa0(band continues)\\xa0CAPTAIN: Looks pretty good at that.\\xa0The tender is coming up from Cherbourg, sir.\\xa0Ah. Mr. Sanderson will go ashore on the tender.\\xa0-Will you show him to the gangway? -Yes, sir.\\xa0-Well, Captain, she\\'s all yours. -Good-bye, sir.\\xa0(whistle blasts)\\xa0(whistle blows)\\xa0MAN: Mind your helm. Steady as you go.\\xa0(whistle blows)\\xa0Julia? Julia!\\xa0JULIA: Sandy! I thought you were in Biarritz.\\xa0My beautiful Julia, to these ears Biarritz has become a dirty word.\\xa0(chuckles) How much did you lose this time?\\xa0These are borrowed trousers. Where\\'s that husband of yours?\\xa0-He didn\\'t come. -Good! Maybe we can cause a scandal.\\xa0I\\'m afraid that would be a little clumsy. I brought the children.\\xa0What about your summer plans? I thought you were taking a house at Deauville.\\xa0I changed my mind. Annette! Norman!\\xa0Sandy! (speaking French)\\xa0She means \"hello.\"\\xa0-Norman. -Good afternoon, sir.\\xa0I have to go over to the right side, the starboard side to see the Marconi aerial.\\xa0Stay right here. I\\'ll try to get a chair.\\xa0Oh, John, stop worrying.\\xa0I\\'m not the first woman in the world who\\'s going to have a baby.\\xa0As far as I\\'m concerned, you are. I\\'ll get a chair.\\xa0Forgive me, Mr. Astor,\\xa0but if you\\'re looking for a chair for Mrs. Astor, perhaps my suitcase would do.\\xa0-Why, thank you. -Mr. Astor, my name\\'s Earl Meeker.\\xa0-Yes. Thank you. -MAN: I\\'m looking for the Widener maid.\\xa0The maid of Mrs. Widener. Is Mrs. Widener\\'s maid around?\\xa0The Wideners? I think I saw them over there...\\xa0I\\'m looking for the Widener maid.\\xa0I\\'m looking for the Widener maid.\\xa0Widener maid. I\\'m looking for the Widener maid.\\xa0Well, don\\'t look at me.\\xa0I\\'ve got so many maids, some of the maids are taking care of the maids.\\xa0Can\\'t say I blame the poor fellow.\\xa0I just haven\\'t got the kind of a face that goes with the bankroll.\\xa0I\\'ll flash my badge and blind a few people.\\xa0Name\\'s Maude Young. Montana lead mines.\\xa0Seasick? That some kind of a cure?\\xa0No, it doesn\\'t cure anything.\\xa0(ship whistle blasts)\\xa0MAN: No running, no pushing.\\xa0(speaking French)\\xa0Have your boarding tickets ready.\\xa0(man speaking French)\\xa0(man speaking French)\\xa0(man continues in French)\\xa0-(tapping desk) -I\\'m Richard Ward Sturges.\\xa0-Get me the proper man. I want to arrange passage. -On the Titanic?\\xa0-I have that in mind. -I\\'m sorry, sir. This first trip has been sold out since March.\\xa0My congratulations. However, I must be on that ship.\\xa0I\\'d like to help you, sir, but I\\'m sorry.\\xa0(speaking foreign language)\\xa0-Pardon. You are Spanish? -We are Basque.\\xa0From wine country. We go to California. Oregon perhaps.\\xa0Start grapes. Make good wine.\\xa0-You have land there? -We buy little piece.\\xa0Well, it needn\\'t be such a little piece.\\xa0Now, you give me that ticket and there\\'s enough money here to buy five times as much land.\\xa0(foreign language)\\xa0(woman speaking foreign language)\\xa0Madam, there\\'s nothing to discuss.\\xa0He can take the next boat and join you in a week or so. One boat\\'s as good as another.\\xa0(foreign language)\\xa0(foreign language)\\xa0All right. I can always get someone else.\\xa0Now, just stop and think.\\xa0How many years would it take you to buy 100 acres?\\xa0Now, go into one of your tribal huddles and convince your wife.\\xa0(foreign language)\\xa0(foreign language)\\xa0-Thank you, Mr., uh... -Uzcadum.\\xa0You\\'ve done me a great favor.\\xa0(whistle blasts)\\xa0MAN (shouting): Tender alongside.

You get the one way back there.\\xa0Don\\'t fight, boys. There\\'s plenty to go around.\\xa0I\\'m the steward assigned to you, lady. Just call me Giff Rogers.\\xa0Carry your bag? Draw you a bath?\\xa0-Shouldn\\'t you be in school somewhere? -(young men laugh)\\xa0Come on. Let\\'s beat it.\\xa0(whistle blows, distant)\\xa0(bell rings)\\xa0Drinks and draw for the first watch. Hurry up, Dan.\\xa0Keep it honest. Keep it fair. Come on. Come on.\\xa0Well, chaps, here we go.\\xa0(laughs) Don\\'t trouble yourselves, gentlemen. Lucky Lightoller.\\xa0-Same old story. -Done it again.\\xa0Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Wilde, Dan, remove your bottles. It\\'s my treat.\\xa0With pleasure.\\xa0All passengers aboard. Stations for leaving harbor.\\xa0-Very good, Thompson. -Way to go, old man.\\xa0And remember: first watch, first man with the ladies.\\xa0(men chuckle)\\xa0(whistle blows)\\xa0Fire all boilers. Have a go, mates. Bend your backs.\\xa0-Slow ahead all. -Slow ahead all, sir.\\xa0(bell rings)\\xa0-Steady as she goes. -Steady as she goes, Quartermaster.\\xa0Steady as she goes, sir.\\xa0-Full ahead all. -Full ahead all, sir.\\xa0(bell rings)\\xa0Full speed ahead from the bridge, sir.\\xa0(shouting) All right, carry on.

This is for first class only.\\xa0Really? I\\'ll do my best to behave properly.\\xa0Oh, sir, Mr. Sturges, you don\\'t remember me, but I was on the Queen Alexandria.\\xa0Of course, you were. Your name is Emma.\\xa0You have a daughter who\\'s married to a dentist in Plymouth.\\xa0So considerate, sir, of you to remember.\\xa0Could you tell me the number of Mrs. Sturges\\'s cabin. please?\\xa0Yes, sir, it\\'s Stateroom A-52, 54.\\xa0It\\'s right over here. But they\\'ve gone up to dinner now, sir.\\xa0-Thank you. -Richard!\\xa0RICHARD: John. Madeleine, my beautiful peacock!\\xa0-This is a surprise! -Yes, it is.\\xa0John, I\\'d like to borrow a shirt and use your razor. I\\'m wearing my complete wardrobe.\\xa0-I left in a hurry. -Well, help yourself. Take whatever you need.\\xa0Thank you. One more thing.\\xa0If you happen to see Julia in the dining room, I\\'d rather you didn\\'t tell her I\\'m aboard.\\xa0I\\'d like to tell her myself.\\xa0\"Jean Pablo Uzcadum\"?\\xa0(orchestra playing)\\xa0(chattering)\\xa0MAUDE: She didn\\'t believe my eagle was real.\\xa0I said, \"What do you want him to do? Flap his wings?\"\\xa0(women laugh)\\xa0Mama, you should\\'ve protested. It\\'s a really bad table.\\xa0There\\'s not a person we know at this end of the room.\\xa0JULIA: Be brave, Annette. These tragedies happen sometimes in life.\\xa0Maitre d\\'hotel, where is Mrs. Sturges\\'s table?\\xa0Mama, look!\\xa0Well, well! This ship is filled with nice people.\\xa0-Hello, Mr. Sturges! -Richard!\\xa0\"Pommery, 1892.\"\\xa0Mrs. Straus, be careful of this old fox. He has plans.\\xa0-NORMAN: Father. -Norman!\\xa0-How did you get aboard? -By the back door. Good to see you, boy.\\xa0-Hello, Sandy. -Well, I can see a bridge game at last!\\xa0Mrs. Widener, George.\\xa0-Annette. -Father.\\xa0Julia.\\xa0You all look splendid. This is gonna be great fun.\\xa0I\\'ll see to it that we have a better table tomorrow.\\xa0Oh, Daddy, I\\'m so glad you\\'re here.\\xa0I hope this doesn\\'t upset your plans, Julia.\\xa0We might be a little crowded, but Norman and I can bunk together.\\xa0-It\\'s wonderful that you could get away after all. -I managed.\\xa0My family will be pleased that you\\'re coming too.\\xa0It makes it a better celebration already. Can I send a message to Grandfather?\\xa0They have a wireless place upstairs. The Marconi room.\\xa0Might be a good idea. Run along.\\xa0Nothing now. Thank you. I\\'ll have a sandwich in the bar.\\xa0Annette, I wonder if you\\'d get a wrap for your mother.\\xa0Yes, angel.\\xa0There\\'s something funny about you, Father.\\xa0I know! I\\'ve never seen you without a flower before.\\xa0Finish your coffee, Julia.\\xa0We can walk around the deck while I tell you what I think of this performance of yours.\\xa0I\\'m in no hurry to finish my coffee and not too interested in your opinion.\\xa0If I hadn\\'t phoned the house from Zurich, you\\'d have got away with it.\\xa0Perhaps you\\'ll explain now why you\\'re kidnapping my children?\\xa0-I\\'m not kidnapping them, Richard. I\\'m rescuing them. -From what?\\xa0-From you. -That was my guess.\\xa0This family reunion story is a deliberate trick to get them away.\\xa0It is, and what\\'s more, they\\'re never going back.\\xa0They\\'re going to stop being rootless, purposeless, superficial hotel children.\\xa0-What\\'s wrong with hotels if they\\'re very good ones? -Oh, Richard, I...\\xa0Richard, please try to see this sanely. We\\'re Americans. We belong in America,\\xa0And yet for years we\\'ve been galloping all over Europe\\xa0to be at the proper places at the proper time:\\xa0winter in Saint Moritz, Deauville in season, summer in...\\xa0What\\'s the use? The same silly calendar, year after year. Look at Annette!\\xa0I have, with great pride.\\xa0She\\'s entertaining. She\\'s discriminating. She has grace and style.\\xa0She\\'s an arrogant little prig.\\xa0So you\\'ve chosen to drag her back to the glories of Mackinac, Michigan.\\xa0Any town in any state becomes comic on your lips,\\xa0but comic or not that\\'s where she\\'s going,\\xa0to a big, ugly, pleasant house with the cheap scent of lilacs around.\\xa0Oh, don\\'t worry. She won\\'t turn out dowdy. She\\'ll meet dozens of nice boys.\\xa0I have something better in mind for Annette than being tied down to some lumber salesman.\\xa0I know what you have in mind, but it won\\'t work.\\xa0I\\'ve seen a great many international marriages, and I\\'ve never seen a happy one.\\xa0-Do you think-- -I don\\'t want to seem overeager, but could we?\\xa0Not tonight, Sandy. Thank you.\\xa0More coffee, Julia?\\xa0Do you think Annette is going to be grateful to you for hauling her into the wilderness?\\xa0In time. And as for Norman, I can only tell you this:\\xa0there\\'s not going to be a carriage with two ponies\\xa0waiting for him at nine o\\'clock every morning.\\xa0From now on, he\\'s going to walk to school.\\xa0Hm. I should\\'ve anticipated this.\\xa0Twenty years ago I made the pardonable mistake of thinking I could civilize a girl\\xa0who bought her hats out of a Sears Roebuck catalog.\\xa0I was wrong.\\xa0And don\\'t think I haven\\'t had my share of regrets.\\xa0One thing, Richard, you\\'ve...\\xa0You\\'ve always been honest.\\xa0-Will this one do? -Yes, thank you.\\xa0-Where\\'s Father? But-- -Never mind. It\\'s bedtime. Come on. It\\'s been a long day.\\xa0I sent the wireless, sir.\\xa0Good.\\xa0Well, one game of checkers before we turn in?\\xa0Yes, sir.\\xa0(bell rings)\\xa0No more seagulls. It\\'s a mystery, it is.\\xa0Take all the fish in the sea. There must be millions of them,\\xa0and you don\\'t feel friendly towards a single one.\\xa0But put a bird in the sky, and you feel like old chums.\\xa0-(taps on wireless) -Listen, lad,\\xa0this\\'ll teach you what kind of a boat you\\'re working on.\\xa0\"Mr. James J. Hays, on board the Titanic.\" When he gets to New York,\\xa0he\\'s gonna have a whole bloomin\\' private train waiting for him.\\xa0That\\'s handy. No waiting for a seat.\\xa0\"Mr. Benjamin Guggenheim,\\xa0Countess of Rothes, Lady Duff-Gordon,\\xa0Colonel Archibald Butts.\"\\xa0The ship I was on before, all we got was weather reports.\\xa0Yes, sir?\\xa0A form, please.\\xa0Hm. Must have broke the pencil.\\xa0Perhaps... Perhaps I could take it down for you, sir.\\xa0No, no. I\\'ll do it myself.\\xa0(George sighs)\\xa0Well, maybe if you would.\\xa0It\\'s to my brother.\\xa0It\\'s Mr. Frank Healey.\\xa0689 Boylston Street, Boston.\\xa0\"I am coming home.\\xa0I think you should advise the family now...\\xa0that last week the authorities in Rome...\"\\xa0\"Authorities in Rome\"?\\xa0\"Authorities in Rome...\"\\xa0-I\\'ve got that, sir. -Oh.\\xa0Uh. Well, then let\\'s say, uh...\\xa0Look. I... I\\'ll be back later.\\xa0(door closes)\\xa0(knocks on door)\\xa0The bar doesn\\'t open till 11:30. It\\'s the rule on a British ship, sir.\\xa0I forgot.\\xa0-A cup of bouillon, sir? -No.\\xa0He\\'s not interested.\\xa0That poor fella had no dinner last night and no breakfast this morning.\\xa0What ails him?\\xa0-I\\'ve seen that look before. He\\'s a runaway. -From what, some woman?\\xa0No. He\\'s running too fast for that.\\xa0What\\'s the commotion?\\xa0Well, where I come from, this would either be a revival meetin\\' or a craps game.\\xa0Step up and get your tickets for the anchor pool.\\xa0Ten dollars gets you a chance to win 600.\\xa0Wait a minute. I wanna get in on this.\\xa0MAUDE: How do you play this?\\xa0Just draw a number. If it corresponds to the minute we drop anchor, you win.\\xa0Five.\\xa0Don\\'t be shy, Mr. Straus. Draw a good one.\\xa0You draw, Mama.\\xa0-What\\'s our lucky number, dear? -Seventeen.\\xa0Hey, Tom... Here you get it, will ya?\\xa0Morning. They\\'re selling tickets on the anchor pool down there.\\xa0-Oh? -Yes, I... I thought you didn\\'t notice.\\xa0Maybe you want a ticket. I could get one for you.\\xa0-No, thank you. I\\'m not much of a gambler. -Oh.\\xa0-How about some soup? Nice and hot. -Thank you. I just had some.\\xa0This is for Purdue. It\\'s a college out in Indiana.\\xa0Everybody thinks it\\'s Princeton, but it\\'s Purdue.\\xa0I see. Well, to answer your questions:\\xa0Her name is Annette, she\\'s going on 18, and I think she\\'s very pretty too.\\xa0Well, now that you brought it up,\\xa0-I think I kinda got off on the wrong foot with her. -Oh?\\xa0Yes, last night, when I asked if I could have the deck chair next to her,\\xa0she said she\\'d rather stand all the way to New York.\\xa0Oh! What\\'s your name?\\xa0Giff Rogers. Gifford is a family name.\\xa0My mother said one of us kids had to be called Gifford.\\xa0-Oh, I\\'m sorry. I always get friendly pop off the bat. -Sit down.\\xa0I\\'m on the tennis team.\\xa0The athletic association shot us over to play Oxford during Easter.\\xa0We didn\\'t win a single match.\\xa0-Will she be at the dance tonight? -She likes music well enough.\\xa0Well, I better hurry and get my blue suit pressed.\\xa0(chuckles) Still the same. Young men hurrying to get their blue suits pressed.\\xa0Mrs. Sturges, I bet I can count on you to put in a good word for me.\\xa0\"When I was one and twenty, I heard a wise man say,\\xa0\\'Give crowns and pounds and guineas, but not your heart away.\\xa0Give pearls away and rubies, but keep your fancy free.\\'\\xa0But I was one and twenty. No use to talk to me.\\xa0When I was one and twenty, I heard him say again,\\xa0\\'The heart out of the bosom was never given in vain.\\xa0\\'Tis paid with sighs aplenty, and sold for endless rue.\\'\"\\xa0That\\'s pretty, but do you believe it?\\xa0I can\\'t answer for myself, but if I were a tennis player from Purdue,\\xa0I wouldn\\'t believe it, not a single word.\\xa0A fine, healthy bumpkin.\\xa0-Are you breaking ground for Annette? -You\\'re up early.\\xa0I had to scratch around for something to wear. Not a bad shop; they have everything.\\xa0-Dinner jackets, I trust? -Naturally.\\xa0It\\'ll be ready tonight. So... life can go on.\\xa0-JULIA: Good morning, Annette. -RICHARD: Morning, darling.\\xa0Oh, Dad, I thought you were a pot of coffee. What time is it?\\xa0Eleven o\\'clock. A brand-new day that\\'s never been touched.\\xa0ANNETTE: I\\'m absolutely famished!\\xa0-That brother of yours, he never picks up anything. Where is he? -Where\\'s my breakfast?\\xa0I sent him to order it half an hour ago.\\xa0-Beautiful! Lanvin? -Mm-hm.\\xa0-This one, Lucile, I imagine. -Yes, angel.\\xa0Your mother seems to have packed everything.\\xa0Of course, some of them will be a little out of place in Mackinac.\\xa0Still, plenty of practical things.\\xa0What? Only high heels? You\\'ll have to have something to walk in.\\xa0Julia, as soon as we arrive, I think you ought to buy her some of those flat shoes.\\xa0They\\'re called ground grippers, I believe. She\\'ll need lots of things.\\xa0-That would be a waste of money for just a short visit. -Visit?\\xa0JULIA: Let\\'s not talk about wardrobe and shoes now. Get up, Annette.\\xa0As your mother has said, it\\'s a brand-new day that\\'s never been touched.\\xa0-(knocking on door) -Yes?\\xa0Ah, thank you, Emma. Those cheeks of yours bloom in the salt air.\\xa0Oh! Mr. Sturges!\\xa0Annette.\\xa0There we are.\\xa0-May I bone your kipper, mademoiselle? -ANNETTE: Yes, angel.\\xa0-Is today the 12th or the 13th? -The 13th.\\xa0With the time difference, they should just be sitting down to luncheon\\xa0in that extraordinary room overlooking the fountains.\\xa0The dear, arthritic old princess sitting under the finest crystal chandelier in Europe,\\xa0and Mr. Paderewski complaining about the draft...\\xa0and at the end of the table, one young man next to an empty chair with a tear in his eye.\\xa0A crystal tear is my guess.\\xa0-What excuse did you give him, Annette? -I dropped them a note.\\xa0-Let\\'s go, Richard. -What note? Was I to be somewhere?\\xa0It\\'s perfectly all right if your mother explained it to them. See you later, Annette.\\xa0Wait a minute. Explain it to me.\\xa0What\\'s the difference one party more or less?\\xa0Now, Julia, a luncheon at the Metternichs\\' is not exactly a wiener roast.\\xa0Was there some reason I wasn\\'t told I was invited to the Metternichs\\'?\\xa0Annette, your mother\\'s a sensible woman.\\xa0She probably felt something might come of it.\\xa0Some involvement with the young master.\\xa0To be perfectly frank, I was afraid. He\\'s an arrogant little toad.\\xa0Mm. He does look a little like a toad, but he\\'s a highly eligible toad.\\xa0Not many young men are related to both the Metternichs and the Rothschilds.\\xa0I don\\'t think he looks in the least like a toad.\\xa0I see no reason we couldn\\'t have left a week later.\\xa0I\\'m sorry I\\'m not there and I think it was mean of you!\\xa0RICHARD: Annette, mind your manners!\\xa0It wasn\\'t a question of a week or two weeks. This was as good a time as any to bow out.\\xa0-Bow out? -Yes. I\\'m afraid so.\\xa0Adieu, great world.\\xa0Your father is saying that I\\'m taking you home for good. You may as well know it now.\\xa0I won\\'t see an arranged marriage, I won\\'t see you jumping from party to party,\\xa0from title to title, all the rest of your life.\\xa0Father, I want to ask you one question. Do you approve of all this?\\xa0Annette, I adore you. You know that.\\xa0Are you going to stay in Michigan for good?\\xa0I\\'m a hopeless case, far too old to alter my preferences now.\\xa0-When are you going back? -RICHARD: On the next boat.\\xa0Whenever you go, I go with you.\\xa0As for you, Mother, I love you very much,\\xa0but my address is Paris, France.\\xa0Thank you, Richard. You were most helpful.\\xa0Now you see why I wanted to steal a little more time.\\xa0Please, Julia, let\\'s not bicker since there\\'s no love lost between us.\\xa0That\\'s the tragic part, Richard.\\xa0There\\'s been so much love lost between us.\\xa0Hurry up! We have our first match at 11:30.\\xa0If it\\'s not asking too much, what match?\\xa0The shuffleboard tournament. I entered us, you and me.\\xa0Good. We\\'re the team to beat.\\xa0-I\\'m going to dress for dinner. -Yes, sir.\\xa0You\\'ll alter course at 10:00. It\\'s posted in the chart house.\\xa0What\\'s this note, \"binoculars\"?\\xa0-That\\'s Murdoch\\'s writing. We\\'re shy on binoculars. -How did that happen?\\xa0I don\\'t know, sir. We\\'ve got just enough for the bridge.\\xa0The lookouts in the crow\\'s nests are doing without.\\xa0-Make out a requisition. We\\'ll pick up some in New York. -Yes, sir.\\xa0-It\\'s very nice material. -Yes, it\\'s a beautiful suit.\\xa0I said it was nice material.\\xa0You did a fast job. Thank you. I better have a handkerchief.\\xa0Norman, it\\'s time for us to pick up our ladies.\\xa0-Norman! -Yes, sir?\\xa0Father, would it be all right if I ate in the cabin tonight?\\xa0Don\\'t be silly, Norman. We\\'re dining at the captain\\'s table.\\xa0That\\'s just it, sir. I\\'d feel out of place.\\xa0There\\'s something bothering you. What is it?\\xa0It\\'s nothing, sir.\\xa0(chuckles) Is this what\\'s worrying you?\\xa0Look, Father. There are two other boys on this ship.\\xa0They\\'re an inch shorter than I am, and they have long trousers.\\xa0Norman, you\\'re a worthless scamp.\\xa0You\\'ve been growing behind my back.\\xa0Mr. Webster, this is no way to let a young man walk out of your shop.\\xa0-It seems you\\'ll have to put in some more overtime. -It\\'s a pleasure, sir.\\xa0Your fitting, Mr. Sturges.\\xa0Thank you, sir.\\xa0Mother, could you help me with this snap, please?\\xa0If you\\'re busy, I can call for the stewardess.\\xa0That won\\'t be necessary.\\xa0I love those earrings on you.\\xa0Thank you.\\xa0Are we going to cross the entire ocean in polite silence?\\xa0Annette, I\\'d be very happy to chatter like a magpie\\xa0if I could think of a single word to say.\\xa0-(knocking on door) -JULIA: Come in.\\xa0-Well, are we ready? -ANNETTE: Yes, angel.\\xa0-Julia, you look very beautiful. -I\\'m glad you\\'re pleased.\\xa0Annette, Norman\\'s at the tailor shop. Will you pick him up?\\xa0I don\\'t want to walk into the dining room with him.\\xa0Then you can trail at a respectful distance.\\xa0-We\\'ll all meet at the captain\\'s table. -Yes, angel.\\xa0Well, Julia, I imagine after a few hours, we\\'ve reached the same conclusion.\\xa0We scream, we shout, we hurt each other, but we calm down.\\xa0Things aren\\'t so bad.\\xa0Things are never bad for you, Richard. You always win.\\xa0I don\\'t regard this as a victory. It\\'s an adjustment.\\xa0Before you go down and eat and drink, you\\'d better know how things are going to be.\\xa0I\\'ve given up on Annette. Her standards will always be the chic club, the best table,\\xa0the Royal Enclosure, and that\\'s her decision. She\\'s almost of age.\\xa0But Norman is still a child. I\\'m not taking any chances with him. He stays in America.\\xa0Now, wait a minute, Julia. What is this all about?\\xa0I should think it\\'d be perfectly clear.\\xa0I\\'m not gonna see Norman thrown away.\\xa0He stays with me and if you try to interfere, I\\'ll be as common as you think I am!\\xa0I\\'ll fight you tooth and nail. I\\'ll take you to the courts!\\xa0Could you be common in a slightly lower voice?\\xa0I\\'ll say it in any tone you want. I\\'ll whisper, I\\'ll write it down.\\xa0That\\'s the way it\\'s going to be! He stays with me!\\xa0You crazy woman. You\\'re talking about the most important thing in my life.\\xa0-I have plans for Norman. -What plans? That he should grow up to be you?\\xa0Possibly. I\\'m satisfied.\\xa0Is it so extraordinary that I should want to have some hint, some portion of myself survive?\\xa0Some portion of-- Yes, I forgot. \"The best-dressed man of his day.\"\\xa0That\\'s what they\\'re going to write on your tombstone.\\xa0That may be all right for you, but I won\\'t have it for Norman. He stays with me.\\xa0My dear Julia, I\\'ve been around enough bridge tables\\xa0to recognize someone who is holding a high trump.\\xa0Play it now, if you\\'re going to.\\xa0We\\'ll discuss it later.\\xa0Now!\\xa0All right, Richard. One question first?\\xa0If it\\'s about Norman, you know the answer.\\xa0No court in the world,\\xa0no power under heaven can force me to give up my son.\\xa0He is not your son.\\xa0(folk music playing)\\xa0(orchestra plays)\\xa0-All I propose, Mr. Straus, is a small game at small stakes. -Oh, yes.\\xa0Don\\'t act as though I were working the banana boats. I prefer good bridge and poverty.\\xa0-SANDY: It sounds rather like Saint Francis, doesn\\'t it? -(people laughing)\\xa0Excuse me. Mr. Sturges, there\\'s someone looking for you.\\xa0-Richard, this young man. -Yes?\\xa0At the door, there\\'s a woman. Some name like Uzcadum.\\xa0-She\\'s French, I guess. -Thank you.\\xa0-RICHARD: Will you excuse me a moment, Captain? -I believe we\\'ve all finished.\\xa0Do you expect to be long in New York, Mrs. Astor?\\xa0Hello. Your mother thought you might be in the mood for dancing tonight.\\xa0She and I got to be very good friends.\\xa0Oh, I\\'m afraid I forgot to mention you, Mr. Rogers. You\\'ll have to forgive me.\\xa0My daughter and I were talking about something else.\\xa0-If Mr. Rogers would like a dance, I\\'d be delighted. -You would?\\xa0The dance floor is this way, isn\\'t it?\\xa0Say, his is great, and the band\\'s slicker than beets.\\xa0Wait till you meet the other fellas.\\xa0-We\\'re going to have one dance. -Just one?\\xa0I was quite horrid to my mother today.\\xa0If I can please her a little by dancing with you...\\xa0as I said before, I\\'d be delighted.\\xa0Okay. What\\'s the difference?\\xa0If you get a good omelet, who cares whether the chicken likes you or not?\\xa0Keep going.\\xa0All right. Now, sign this too.\\xa0Both of them.\\xa0I still say, not right to sign this. I am not head of family. You--\\xa0Please, Mrs. Uzcadum, do me a favor and stop worrying. Here, sign it.\\xa0-(music stops) -(applause)\\xa0(music continues)\\xa0Now, you keep these papers. I\\'ll send the steward tomorrow.\\xa0Say... We\\'re getting up a bridge game.\\xa0Sandy Comstock tells me you\\'re a player from way back.\\xa0Yes.\\xa0(door closes)\\xa0You need a topcoat, Richard. It\\'s grown cold.\\xa0Yes, it has.\\xa0The Labrador current.\\xa0I wonder if you\\'d tell me, Julia.\\xa0Have I been the laughingstock of our friends all these years?\\xa0Does everybody know?\\xa0No one except you and me.\\xa0Aren\\'t you forgetting at least one other person?\\xa0Not even he. I never saw him again.\\xa0What very good manners.\\xa0There\\'s no way for me to make it seem right.\\xa0It happened after one of those endless rows and private humiliations...\\xa0in the days before you made me over into your image.\\xa0One of the summers we had the beach house.\\xa0I\\'d left a party that night because I knew I\\'d cry\\xa0if there was one more reference made to my gaucherie, to the...\\xa0To the dress I had chosen to wear.\\xa0On the beach by our cottage,\\xa0there was a young man skipping stones across the water.\\xa0He assured me he was not a burglar, and we began to talk.\\xa0He said something admiring to me when I needed it most.\\xa0A pure, sweet, unsolicited compliment.\\xa0I... I took his face in my hands and kissed him out of gratitude.\\xa0You...\\xa0You needn\\'t trouble yourself as to who he was...\\xa0except that he was a much nicer person than you or I.\\xa0(purse hits deck)\\xa0I think I understand.\\xa0From now on, Norman belongs to you. I shall make no claim.\\xa0Both of you will be taken care of decently.\\xa0But I don\\'t want to see him or hear from him or... be remembered by him.\\xa0-Is that really necessary? -I\\'m afraid it is.\\xa0As you pointed out, Norman and I began as strangers.\\xa0So be it.\\xa0Oh, my poor Richard. How you hate me.\\xa0And for the wrong reasons.\\xa0Not because I committed an offense against common decency,\\xa0but because Norman isn\\'t an elegant extension of Richard Ward Sturges.\\xa0For you, what happened isn\\'t a mortal sin.\\xa0It is an inexcusable breach of etiquette.\\xa0Thank you, Julia. I stand reproved.\\xa0Good evening, Mr....\\xa0Harry. Thank you.\\xa0I see you have your game.\\xa0And you\\'re in it. Mr. Guggenheim\\'s been keeping the seat warm.\\xa0Two no trump. A heart bid from there.\\xa0You can only play one more rubber, Mr. Straus.\\xa0-Whenever you feel like stopping, I can take over, sir. -My trick.\\xa0Do you mind?\\xa0Aldebaran...\\xa0you lonely star.\\xa0GEORGE: Look around at the others.\\xa0The friendly Pleiades are better off. There\\'s seven of \\'em.\\xa0Now, wait. Let me count.\\xa0Answer up for the roll call.\\xa0There\\'s four, six, seven.\\xa0They\\'re all there.\\xa0Have you ever noticed, my dear lady, that the stars are never late?\\xa0They made you cry,\\xa0or wasn\\'t it the stars?\\xa0Yes. Yes, I... I\\'m drunk.\\xa0I\\'m always two things: I\\'m drunk and I\\'m helpful.\\xa0Thank you. I don\\'t need any help.\\xa0Then you\\'re very, very unique. Oh! \"Very unique.\"\\xa0It\\'s a grammatical error. \"Unique\" stands by itself.\\xa0(hits deck)\\xa0Are you hurt?\\xa0(groans) I\\'m all right.\\xa0If... you would just be so kind as to point me toward the bar.\\xa0You\\'re going to your cabin. What number is it?\\xa0My dear, unique lady, I am going to the bar.\\xa0No, you\\'re not. Where\\'s the key to your cabin?\\xa0-I\\'ll send in the ship\\'s doctor. -No, no, no, let him sleep.\\xa0I\\'ve got some, uh, spirits of ammonia over here.\\xa0I\\'ll get it. Sit down.\\xa0Take this.\\xa0Good night.\\xa0Thank you for being so generous.\\xa0-That\\'s all right. Just go to bed. -You know what I mean.\\xa0Thank you for not mentioning my strange luggage.\\xa0Are you a minister?\\xa0A priest, or rather, I was until last week.\\xa0At three o\\'clock on April 8th,\\xa0my duties, my privileges as a servant of God were formally terminated.\\xa0It was this.\\xa0You know why I started, or at least the reason I gave myself?\\xa0A priest in a slum parish knows all the sadness of the world. He needs support.\\xa0So I used to lean on a little Hennessy\\'s. Just a little at first.\\xa0People said, \"Well, that\\'s only natural. The young father has a bad cold.\"\\xa0(chuckles)\\xa0It got so I used to have those colds in the middle of July, lots of \\'em.\\xa0I can hear the bishop\\'s voice now.\\xa0\"You prefer that stuff to your God?\"\\xa0Well, God and I knew better, but... I couldn\\'t stop,\\xa0because I had a private devil all of my own.\\xa0In Rome, they were very kind, but they were very final.\\xa0I was sacked, and prayed for, and sent off in the morning.\\xa0How do you cover that in ten words in a wireless\\xa0to a family that loved you and sacrificed for you?\\xa0You see, my dear lady, you\\'re not the only one who walks in trouble.\\xa0Goodnight.\\xa0(door closes)\\xa0-Can I have some eggs, please? -Three minutes.\\xa0-How\\'s topside? -(bell ringing)\\xa0Is that bridge game still going on in the lounge?\\xa0I don\\'t think they\\'re ever gonna stop.\\xa0Time to relieve the chief.\\xa0Be careful of that coffee. It can stand up and walk.\\xa0(chuckles)\\xa0Morning, Chief.\\xa0-Good morning. -Ready to relieve.\\xa0Steering south, 71 west. Speed 21 knots.\\xa0Twenty-one? Who ordered the increase?\\xa0The captain.\\xa0Jackson.\\xa0Take over a moment. I must speak to the captain.\\xa0♪ Holy, holy, holy\\xa0♪ Though the darkness hide thee ♪\\xa0♪ Though the eye of sinful man ♪\\xa0♪ Thy glory may not see\\xa0♪ Only thou art holy\\xa0♪ There is none beside thee ♪\\xa0♪ Perfect in power ♪\\xa0♪ In love and purity\\xa0♪ Amen\\xa0The Lord bless us and keep us.\\xa0The Lord make his face to shine upon us and be gracious unto us.\\xa0The Lord lift up his countenance upon us, and give us peace now and forevermore.\\xa0Amen.\\xa0-Good morning. -Good morning, Captain.\\xa0Lovely day, isn\\'t it?\\xa0LIGHTOLLER: Excuse me, sir.\\xa0There\\'s an iceberg warning posted in the chart house.\\xa0Yes, I know. I put it there.\\xa0I just wondered about our speed, sir.\\xa0It\\'s a clear sea,\\xa0and our track takes us quite a bit south of the reported ice field.\\xa0-Anything else? -No, sir.\\xa0Er... Mr. and Mrs. Astor, I should like you to meet our second officer, Mr. Lightoller.\\xa0How do you do?\\xa0-He\\'s worried about our ship. -Not worried, sir.\\xa0I remember a man like that in the old days. Always afraid we were carrying too much sail.\\xa0But the wind never did us any harm. I like your spirit, Mr. Lightoller.\\xa0Thank you, sir.\\xa0-All right if I skip now, Mother? Big match coming up. -Yes, dear.\\xa0I believe that\\'s your trick, Widener.\\xa0Are you leaving it there to hatch?\\xa0(chuckles) Sorry, Sturges. I\\'m knocked out.\\xa0It\\'s almost 10:30, Father. We should have a warm-up.\\xa0This may be a tough match.\\xa0You\\'ll have to find someone else, Norman. I\\'m busy.\\xa0-Yes, sir. -SANDY: An evenhanded rubber.\\xa0That\\'s enough for me.\\xa0I guess it\\'s time for us all to quit.\\xa0I see no reason for stopping. We\\'ll get a fourth.\\xa0I\\'ll be glad to fill in, Mr. Sturges, if it\\'s all right with everybody?\\xa0Please do. Cut.\\xa0The name\\'s Meeker. Earl Meeker.\\xa0All right. Let\\'s have more coffee and double the stakes.\\xa0-How much do I owe? -We\\'ll let you know.\\xa0Excuse me, Father, but if you\\'re busy, maybe I could have the match postponed--\\xa0I told you, Norman, I\\'m not interested in the match. Find someone else!\\xa0Yes, sir.\\xa0-RICHARD: A spade. -SANDY: Pass.\\xa0MAUDE: Two hearts.\\xa0He certainly clouded up.\\xa0Well, a word\\'ll do it faster than a hickory stick anytime.\\xa0A spade, two hearts. Your call.\\xa0MEEKER: I pass.\\xa0Morning.\\xa0Hello.\\xa0I guess it\\'s of no importance, but I wanted to tell you something about last night.\\xa0No need to.\\xa0You danced with me four times. It\\'s more than I figured on.\\xa0No, I mean the way I walked off without saying anything.\\xa0It wasn\\'t very adult of me, and I believe in being adult.\\xa0Forget it. You did your bit. Only I kind of figured you were having a good time.\\xa0-To be frank, I was. -So you left me standing right in the middle of the floor?\\xa0That\\'s just it! I didn\\'t know what to do\\xa0when the orchestra started playing that funny dance.\\xa0-What do they call it? -\"The Navajo Rag\"?\\xa0-That\\'s the one. I\\'d never heard it-- -Never heard it before?\\xa0Where have you been? Locked up in some art gallery?\\xa0Why, that\\'s the hottest jig that kids do!\\xa0Yes, I noticed those girls with your friends.\\xa0They seemed to... well... shake automatically,\\xa0especially the pretty one with the dark hair.\\xa0Oh, the dark-haired one! She\\'s a glue-foot.\\xa0Come here, I\\'ll show you how to do it.\\xa0Now, look, all you have to do is this.\\xa0(clapping)\\xa0♪ There\\'s a dance they do on the reservation ♪\\xa0♪ It\\'s a dip and a glide and a hesitation ♪\\xa0♪ Then you grab your squaw and drag ♪\\xa0♪ They call it the Navajo Rag ♪\\xa0-♪ Ho, ho, ho, that Navajo Rag ♪ -(harmonica plays)\\xa0♪ What a rag, what a rag what a rag ♪\\xa0♪ Ho, ho, ho, that Navajo drag\\xa0♪ That drag that drag, that drag ♪\\xa0♪ Shake your moccasins and roll your eyes ♪\\xa0♪ Tear my blanket make my feathers fly ♪\\xa0♪ Whirl me\\xa0♪ Twirl me\\xa0♪ Whirl me, twirl me to that Navajo Rag ♪\\xa0(applause)\\xa0If we\\'re going to be stared at, I think we should do this to real music.\\xa0Whenever there\\'s another dance, will you ask me?\\xa0Goodbye, gentlemen.\\xa0Bye, Giff.\\xa0Bye.\\xa0Yee-hoo!\\xa0-Three spades. -Double.\\xa0-Content. -Content.\\xa0(bugle plays)\\xa0Why do the British find it necessary to announce dinner as if it were a cavalry charge?\\xa0-Shall we break? -Just when I\\'m getting some good cards?\\xa0Your grief has been noted. We\\'ll break later.\\xa0Oh, that\\'s what you said about luncheon.\\xa0By the time we dock, I\\'m gonna be one long loaf of liverwurst.\\xa0Sorry, partner. Not much there.\\xa0-Oh, Harry. -HARRY: Yes, sir?\\xa0-Is the water still hot? -I just brought it, sir.\\xa0Thank you.\\xa0Is it necessary to lurk in dark corners?\\xa0I\\'ve come to ask you to have dinner with the children.\\xa0What I really mean is, to have dinner with Norman.\\xa0Don\\'t worry. You won\\'t have to put up with me. I\\'ll eat in the cabin.\\xa0Oh, please, Richard. Don\\'t take it out on him.\\xa0He\\'s too young to be slapped in the face without any explanation.\\xa0Then give him the explanation.\\xa0(Julia sighs)\\xa0Richard, you can\\'t mean that.\\xa0Richard, it doesn\\'t concern him. It\\'s an issue between you and me.\\xa0Norman adores you. You\\'re the man he\\'s loved since the moment he opened his eyes.\\xa0Can\\'t you, for the few days we\\'re still together,\\xa0at least show him the courtesy you would show a headwaiter?\\xa0I\\'m sorry, Julia.\\xa0You\\'re asking me to do something which involves character.\\xa0As you have pointed out, I am not a man of character.\\xa0Oh, please, Richard. Please!\\xa0You\\'re in my light, Julia.\\xa0MAUDE: We made it, partner. Three spades, doubled.\\xa0Well, aren\\'t we the lucky ones!\\xa0(tapping on wireless)\\xa0How long will it take to get to Boston?\\xa0About seven or eight hours, sir.\\xa0There\\'s a lot of traffic going out.\\xa0Seems like when we get to New York, everybody\\'s...\\xa0planning to have a party.\\xa0Yes, sir. About seven or eight hours.\\xa0Well, I guess that\\'ll be soon enough.\\xa0That\\'ll be 11 shillings, sir. Shall I bill it to your cabin?\\xa0-Yes, sir? -What time did this message come in?\\xa0I think Phillips handled that one, sir. He\\'s having his dinner now.\\xa0Check your log. There\\'s a mix-up.\\xa0This morning we got an iceberg warning from the Baltic.\\xa0Half an hour ago, this one from the Caronia was delivered.\\xa0Yes, that\\'s right, sir. It came in at 7:40.\\xa0But it\\'s dated April 12th, two days ago. Why the delay?\\xa0I don\\'t know, sir. Something to do with transmission.\\xa0We got it half an hour ago and sent it straight to the bridge.\\xa0-Well, what did they say? -Held up at the other end, sir.\\xa0-Hello, Chief. Thought you\\'d be having dinner. -Finished, sir.\\xa0Where\\'s your plot on that iceberg reported by the Baltic?\\xa0Right here, sir. Ahead and slightly north of our track.\\xa0We should sight it about 8:00 in the morning.\\xa0There\\'s another report from the Caronia. Plot it in, will you?\\xa042 north, 49.50 west.\\xa0That would put it up here, sir.\\xa0But the Caronia report was filed two days ago.\\xa0That\\'d be about right. There\\'s a strong southerly drift.\\xa0A large enough berg could have moved down there...\\xa0almost where the Baltic sighted it.\\xa0Do you want to alter course, sir?\\xa0-What\\'s the weather forecast? -Clear and calm.\\xa0Oh, I don\\'t think so. No need to alter course yet.\\xa0I\\'ll be on the bridge during the morning watch.\\xa0Shouldn\\'t be too hard to spot it in daylight.\\xa0Mr. Murdoch, I thought I\\'d let you know,\\xa0the captain will be topside for the morning watch.\\xa0Night order book as is.\\xa0-We gonna stay at 22 knots? -Why not?\\xa0-At 30, we couldn\\'t reach that berg before daylight. -That\\'s true, not this one.\\xa0But what if these are two different icebergs?\\xa0(piano plays)\\xa0♪ Oh, Amherst, brave Amherst\\xa0♪ \\'Twas the name known to fame in days of yore ♪\\xa0♪ May it ever be glorious\\xa0♪ Till the sun shall climb the heavens no more ♪\\xa0YOUNG MEN: ♪ Bo-bo-bo-bo bo-bo-bo-bo ♪\\xa0GIFF: ♪ Oh, oh, Lord Jeffrey Amherst was a soldier of the king ♪\\xa0EVERYONE: ♪ And he came from across the sea ♪\\xa0GIFF: ♪ To the Frenchmen and the Indians he didn\\'t do a thing ♪\\xa0♪ In the wilds of this wild country ♪\\xa0♪ In the wilds of this wild country ♪\\xa0♪ And for his royal majesty he fought with all his might ♪\\xa0♪ He was a soldier loyal and true ♪\\xa0♪ And he conquered all the enemies ♪\\xa0-♪ that came within his sight -ANNETTE: ♪ Sight\\xa0♪ And he looked around for more when he was through ♪\\xa0♪ Oh, Amherst, brave Amherst\\xa0♪ \\'Twas the name known to fame in days of yore ♪\\xa0♪ May it ever be glorious\\xa0♪ Till the sun shall climb the heavens no more ♪\\xa0Should be seeing gulls by morning.\\xa0The birds of the Grand Banks, fair filled with courage.\\xa0Overtrumped.

Is this ship going to sink?\\xa0She is. I\\'m ordering all women and children into the boats.\\xa0As for the rest of us, perhaps some vessel can get to us in time.\\xa0Captain Smith, in other words, there aren\\'t enough lifeboats for the men.\\xa0(gunshot)\\xa0(ship whistle blasts)\\xa0(ship alarm blaring)\\xa0MAN: All passengers go to their cabins and put on life jackets.\\xa0There is no cause for alarm.\\xa0You\\'ll find life jackets on the rack in your wardrobe.\\xa0Please proceed to your cabins immediately.\\xa0You\\'re to put on your life jackets.\\xa0After that, you\\'re to proceed to the promenade deck by the after ladder.\\xa0(alarm blaring)\\xa0(whistle blasts)\\xa0Did you hear what\\'s happened?\\xa0We ran into an iceberg. None of us even saw it. Isn\\'t that the biggest cheat?\\xa0I knew there was something. It woke me. Norman, get dressed immediately.\\xa0Please relax. I\\'ve talked to the captain. There was a collision of sorts.\\xa0The steamship company evidently felt we needed something to break the monotony.\\xa0-Is there any danger? -RICHARD: Danger? On a ship like this?\\xa0Nonsense. However, we have to follow instructions.\\xa0Now, put on warm things, everybody.\\xa0Comfortable, but as becoming as possible.\\xa0Annette, get the other jackets from in there.\\xa0It might be a good idea to bring some blankets along.\\xa0It may be chilly in the lifeboats.\\xa0Lifeboats?

We\\'re assigned to number six lifeboat.\\xa0Remember, number six.\\xa0Well, I believe we\\'re ready.\\xa0Norman, you better take these. Catch.\\xa0Father?\\xa0Haven\\'t you forgotten something too?\\xa0Oh, I have.\\xa0Pay a thousand dollars to ride on the greatest ship that was ever built\\xa0and three days out somebody pokes a hole in it.\\xa0Why don\\'t they patch it up and leave us alone?\\xa0Hey, don\\'t you walk out on me.

Keep the passage clear.\\xa0Mrs. Sturges, they say it\\'s nothing, but they\\'re lying. There\\'s water below.\\xa0And now somebody says there aren\\'t enough lifeboats for the men.\\xa0(ship whistle blasts)\\xa0Richard, I see they got you into one of those. This doesn\\'t fit.\\xa0-You\\'re not busy. I may need you. -Can\\'t be that bad.\\xa0I\\'m afraid it is. We may be having sand for supper tonight. Come on.\\xa0(alarm blaring continues)\\xa0-MAN: Put on your life jackets! -(crowd clamoring)\\xa0MAN: Leave everything behind!\\xa0Walk by the after deck! Please, put on your life jackets.\\xa0Walk by the after deck. Please, you must take a life jacket. Come on.\\xa0Steward! Can\\'t you get some order here?\\xa0They don\\'t want to go, sir. We can\\'t make them understand about the trouble.\\xa0Well, give me a try. Here.\\xa0-Mrs. Uzcadum. -(foreign language)\\xa0-(foreign language) -Get to your feet!\\xa0-No, safer place here. -I am at the moment the head of this family. Now, get up!\\xa0(Sandy speaking foreign language)\\xa0-(anxious chattering) -(alarm blaring continues)\\xa0MAN: Remain on this deck. The boats will be lowered down.\\xa0-I don\\'t think it\\'s so serious. We\\'ll get help. -I think so too.\\xa0I\\'ll bet there are practically seven or eight ships coming right now.\\xa0But anyway, just in case we get on different boats...\\xa0if you get to New York first, would you mind calling up home for me?\\xa0Of course not. They\\'ll all be worried.\\xa0There\\'s just Jackie. That\\'s my kid sister.\\xa0Tell her I didn\\'t win any medal, but I bought her a pocketbook instead...\\xa0with beads on it.\\xa0MAN: Keep your falls clear!\\xa0It was supposed to get there for Easter, but I\\'ll bet it didn\\'t.\\xa0You\\'ll be there to tell her, Giff. You\\'re just as apt to be there before me.\\xa0Oh, sure.\\xa0But even if not, there\\'s one thing I want you to know.\\xa0I don\\'t think you\\'ll believe it, but I wouldn\\'t have missed this boat trip.\\xa0Not for anything.\\xa0(ship whistle blasts)\\xa0Officer, Officer, have you room here for four more?\\xa0I think so, sir. Are they assigned to this boat?\\xa0They are now. Go ahead, Mrs. Uzcadum.\\xa0RICHARD: Here\\'s a nice lady. She\\'ll take care of you.\\xa0Bon voyage, Madeleine, my dear.\\xa0Bless you, Richard.\\xa0LIGHTOLLER: Stand back, there.\\xa0Hop in for you, lad.\\xa0Take a turn on that line! Keep your falls clear!\\xa0Keep your falls clear!\\xa0-Some loose ends to take care of, Julia. -Yes, I saw.\\xa0They\\'re loading your lifeboat.\\xa0I\\'d better go to my own. It\\'s on the other side.\\xa0It will be a long walk, Richard, but thank you for lying.\\xa0I know you\\'re trying to make it easy for us.\\xa0This way is easier for me too.\\xa0Oh, Richard, where did we miss out on each other?\\xa0I... I beg your pardon, sir.\\xa0I put you down as a useless man, somebody to lead a cotillion.\\xa0After all, it was my major talent.\\xa0Oh, I\\'m sorry. Sorry about everything.\\xa0(cries)\\xa0We have no time to catalog our regrets.\\xa0All we can do is pretend 20 years didn\\'t happen.\\xa0It\\'s June again.\\xa0You\\'re walking under some elm trees in a white muslin dress.\\xa0The loveliest creature I ever laid eyes on.\\xa0That summer, when I asked you to marry me...\\xa0I pledged my eternal devotion.\\xa0I would consider it a great favor, Julia,\\xa0if you would accept a restatement of that pledge.\\xa0-(ship whistle blasts) -Oh!\\xa0-Please, madam. -(Julia sobs)\\xa0Go ahead, my dear.\\xa0(Julia sobs)\\xa0MAN: Hurry up!
